The idea of the walk is for men to speak out against violence against women by literally walking a mile in women's shoes. Typically, men wear high heels for the event, because it makes the biggest impact...and it's very funny! \r\nThe walk will be the focus of the event, but we will also be featuring a musical performance by the River Music Experience band Whoozdads featuring Ellis Kell. There will also be other wellness and empowerment performances/activities, and there will be personal stories from survivors of domestic violence. \r\nWe will be selling breakfast items for a low cost, and there will be other vendors selling items that will benefit our program. We will be selling event T-shirts as well that are pretty cool. \r\nWomen and children are of course welcome and encouraged to come to the event, but the idea is to have men do the marching. Certainly women and children can walk along with the men, but will have the pleasure of wearing more comfortable shoes. \r\nWe have never done this event before, so we don't know what type of turnout to expect. We're hoping for a big one, of course! We are recruiting from all over to try to encourage men of all ages and backgrounds to come out and show that they are ready to put a stop to domestic violence! \r\nThe event will begin at 8am with registration from 8-9. The actual walk will begin at 9am and run until about 10am, depending on how long it takes for all the guys to finish. Following the walk, there will be various types of entertainment, awards for those gentlemen who really get into it, and survivor stories. The event will end by 12pm. \r\nThe event is located at Schwiebert Riverfront Park in downtown Rock Island. \r\nThere is no cost to register, and I would encourage any interested parties to please register ahead of time with me by calling (563) 468.2313 or emailing me. This saves them time on the day of the event, and helps me know how many people to be expecting. \r\nPlease let me know if you have any questions.

Our campus is a Smoke Free Campus. As you are all aware the STATE OF IOWA passed the Iowa Smokefree Air Act that was implemented on July 1, 2008. So that there is no confusion for anyone I have enclosed details from state officials and the Community Health Consultant Tobacco-Free QC Area pertaining to the STATE OF IOWA LAW. \r\n\r\nThe Iowa Smokefree Air Act prohibits smoking in public places as well as defined outdoor areas. Specific to public or private educational facilities, the Act requires the following:\r\n\r\n   Campus buildings and all campus grounds, including parking lots and any other outdoor area under the control of the college, be smoke-free\r\n\r\n   Proper signage be visible to designate the campus buildings and also grounds areas as smoke-free\r\n\r\nOur campus is a Smoke Free Campus; there is NO Smoking area on the grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMark L.

Read test directions carefully.  Note any important facts (dates, equations, memory cues, etc.) at the top of the test.  Develop a plan by looking over the test allotting adequate time for each section.\r\n\r\nDuring the Test:  Mark questions you wish to return to with a check mark or dot.\r\n\r\n  Multiple Choice Questions:  Try to remember the answer before reading the choices, read all answer choices, cross out the choices you know are incorrect.\r\n\r\n  Essay Questions:  Read all questions, start with the easiest one, brainstorm before you write, jot down ideas to include in your answer, write legibly in clear, concise language.  If you do not know the answer, take time to write what you remember about the subject as you may hit on something and receive partial credit.\r\n\r\n  True/False Questions:  Look for key words as statements with all, always, never, every and none are usually false.  Statements with usually, often, sometimes, most and many are more likely to be true.\r\n\r\n  Open Book Tests:  Be prepared to locate information quickly by using self-stick notes, highlighting information, and writing information you know you will need on one page.\r\n\r\nCheck all answers carefully to be sure you understand all questions correctly.\r\n\r\nPost-Test:  Go over all returned tests to locate the correct answers.

One method utilized to focus reading is to turn each bold face subtitle into a question.\r\n\r\nReview by asking yourself the author's main idea.  Then review using the scanning process asking yourself to restate the purpose or point of each section and to define each bold or italicized word.  \r\n\r\n\r\nO'Brien, L. (2009).

Homework is a \"must do\".

Adapting to different personalities, teaching styles, and expectations is part of becoming a professional.  \r\n\r\nSit in the front of the class whenever possible.  Research shows that sitting in the front of the class is directly related to higher grades.  \r\n\r\nBe a good group member.  Do your portion of the work and do it well, have a positive attitude, support other group members, and be open to new ideas.\r\n\r\nBe on time to each class.  Plan to arrive early.  Take a moment to relax and use the time to look over your notes, chat with classmates, or speak to your instructor.  \r\n\r\nStay for the entire class.  Instructors often summarize the day's learning and discuss upcoming assignments.  \r\n\r\nBe an active class participant.  You will learn and remember more.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunicate with your instructors.  Do not hesitate to contact an instructor when you have a question, concern, or problem.

When you miss classes, you miss lectures, notes, class discussions, homework explanations, and assignments.\"  (O'Brian, 2009)  There is no way to make-up everything you missed.  KU terms are accelerated ten week terms.  A great deal of knowledge and information is shared during one class session.

Below is a list of frequently asked questions regarding living expense checks. The business will begin requesting checks the week of January 4th, 2010. All checks should be received by the end of the term if you are budgeting for these funds.  \r\n\r\nLIVING EXPENSE FAQ\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A LIVING EXPENSE?\r\nA living expense or stipend is scheduled when you take out extra loan funds which create a credit balance on your student account.\r\n\r\nHOW DO I KNOW IF I QUALIFY FOR LIVING EXPENSE?\r\nSchedule a meeting with your FA representative to talk about eligibility and taking out additional loan funds.  An Estimated Award Letter is provided to each student.\r\n\r\nWHEN CAN I EXPECT MY CHECK?\r\nChecks are requested during the second half of each term.  Checks cannot be requested during the last 7 days of any month due to month end reconciliation process.\r\n\r\nHOW LONG DO CHECKS TAKE ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN REQUESTED?\r\nProcessing time can take up to 2 weeks.  Checks are cut from our corporate office in Atlanta and go through 3 levels of approval before being released.  Checks are received on Mondays and Thursdays and will be available after 12:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nHOW CAN I BUDGET FOR THIS MONEY?\r\nChecks will come in at different times each term so budget for the end of the term. \r\n\r\nWHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT WILL DELAY MY CHECK?\r\nLoans not posting, not having current attendance in all scheduled classes or being placed on hold with Student Accounts, Financial Aid or Academics.  *ANY SCHEDULE CHANGE CAN ALSO CAUSE A DELAY ESPECIALLY IF YOU ADD OR DROP A CLASS.  ALWAYS BE SURE TO INFORM YOUR FA REP OF ANY TYPE OF SCHEDULE CHANGES.\r\n\r\nHOW AM I NOTIFIED THAT MY CHECK HAS BEEN REQUESTED OR RECEIVED?\r\nThe business office relies on email to contact students.  If you have problems with your Quad account we can also use a personal email account.  This information can be provided to the business office at any time.\r\n\r\nDO I NEED MY ID TO PICK UP MY CHECK?\r\nYes.  A picture ID is required when checks are picked up.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF I WANT MY CHECK MAILED TO ME?\r\nThat information can be relayed to the business office once you have been notified that your check has been received.  Always be sure to verify your current mailing address with us so that we can ensure timely delivery.\r\n\r\nWHAT IF MY CHECK DOES NOT MATCH MY ESTIMATED AWARD LETTER?\r\nAward Letters are estimated and loan and grant amounts are not guaranteed until they are recieved but you can always speak with your FA rep for clarification.\r\n\r\nWHY DOES MY FRIEND GET MORE MONEY THAN ME?\r\nEach individuals financial aid and eligibility is different.\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE THE BUSINESS OFFICE HOURS:\r\nNormal business office hours are 7:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday thru Thursday and until 5:00 p.m. on Fridays.  Your check can be picked up at the front desk if you need to come in after normal business office hours.\r\n\r\nWe hope that these questions help explain the process, but feel free to contact us if you need more information.\r\n\r\nAs always your patienc","NoteBy":"Stacey Jones","NoteID":50427758,"NoteType":"C2K","TaskType":"KU Admissions","syDepartmentID":5,"syStudentID":185900},{"BusinessUnit":"","DateCreated":"2009-12-10T18:29:24.423Z","Department":"","EditedBy":null,"Note":"Instructor : Vickie Palzewicz<BR/>Work Phone :  <BR/> Email : vpalzewicz@kaplan.edu <BR/> Class : MT340-01AU <BR/><BR/>Sent email and called regarding grades and participation.

As you are all aware the STATE OF IOWA passed the Iowa Smokefree Air Act that was implemented on July 1, 2008.

Welcome to the new term.  Below is a list of frequently asked questions regarding living expense checks.  The business office will begin requesting checks in mid October.  Keep in mind this will be the last check you receive before the Holiday Season!  \r\nEnjoy the term.\r\n\r\nLIVING EXPENSE FAQ\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A LIVING EXPENSE?\r\nA living expense or stipend is scheduled when you take out extra loan funds which create a credit balance on your student account.\r\n\r\nHOW DO I KNOW IF I QUALIFY FOR LIVING EXPENSE?\r\nSchedule a meeting with your FA representative to talk about eligibility and taking out additional loan funds.  An Estimated Award Letter is provided to each student.\r\n\r\nWHEN CAN I EXPECT MY CHECK?\r\nChecks are requested during the second half of each term.  Checks cannot be requested during the last 7 days of any month due to month end reconciliation process.\r\n\r\nHOW LONG DO CHECKS TAKE ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN REQUESTED?\r\nProcessing time can take up to 2 weeks.  Checks are cut from our corporate office in Atlanta and go through 3 levels of approval before being released.  Checks are received on Mondays and Thursdays and will be available after 12:00 p.m.\r\n\r\nWHAT ARE SOME THINGS THAT WILL DELAY MY CHECK?\r\nLoans not posting, not having current attendance in all scheduled classes or being placed on hold with Student Accounts, Financial Aid or Academics.  *ANY SCHEDULE CHANGE CAN ALSO CAUSE A DELAY ESPECIALLY IF YOU ADD OR DROP A CLASS.  ALWAYS BE SURE TO INFORM YOUR FA REP OF ANY TYPE OF SCHEDULE CHANGES.\r\n\r\nHOW AM I NOTIFIED THAT MY CHECK HAS BEEN REQUESTED OR RECEIVED?\r\nThe business office relies on email to contact students.
